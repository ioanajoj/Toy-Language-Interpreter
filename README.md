# Toy-Language-Interpreter

The assignment developed during the Advanced Methods of Programming Course asked for an interpreter of a self-defined language.
The language operated with expressions and instructions starting from the basic: if, while, for,
to the more advanced concurrency controlling ones: fork, cyclic barrier, lock.
